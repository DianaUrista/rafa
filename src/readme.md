"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dis
like men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of th

e moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to
 those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the s
ame as saying th
rough shrinking from to
il and pain. These cases are perfe
ctly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being
 able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequ
ently occur
 that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always hold
 s in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
